### Project#3
Description: The perpose of this project was to teach us how to use the Fastify Get verb and practice using routes and query parameters. For the javascript part we had four functions to code. The first was a function called validDenomination(coin) which returns true if the coin function parameter is a valid coin value of either 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, or 100. The second was a function called valueFromCoinObject(obj) which returns the calculated value of a single coin object from the obj function parameter. The third was a function called valueFromArray(arr) which iterates through an array of coin objects and returns the final calculated value of all coin objects. The final function was called coinCount(...coinage) which calls and returns the result of the valueFromArray() function which is the value of all coin objects with the coinage array function parameter.
